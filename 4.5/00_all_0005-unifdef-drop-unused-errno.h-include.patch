Subject: [PATCH 05/11] unifdef: drop unused errno.h include

This is the only header on my system that ends up requiring kernel
headers, so if the kernel headers aren't available, we end up being
unable to install kernel headers :).

Since this file doesn't actually use anything from errno.h, drop
the include so it at least makes us a bit more robust on glibc.
